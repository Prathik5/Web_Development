# Web_Development
This is a repository where I learn web development from Udemy

This is where my journey started, there are a lot of assignments solved, a lot of code written, erased, etc.

Here I use all the technologies needed to get me started on my development journey like 
`HTML`, `CSS` -> `BootStrap`, `JavaScript`, `NodeJS`, `ExpressJS`, `MongoDB`

There are a lot of smaller projects, which I built during the BootCamp, and a lot of exercises as well. These exercises helped me a lot.

I'd Like to thank Colt Steele for helping me with this journey
